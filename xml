<p>FaceApp is taking the world by a storm. For many, this is the first time they are seeing or using the app. However, this is no new app. In fact, <font color="#ff57f1">FaceApp just got a huge boost from an unlikely source &#8211; viral marketing.</font> Using the power of sophisticated AI, shockingly near-perfect photo filters are allowing people to travel through time to see what they would look like when they get old and much more.<br></p>



<p>Artificial intelligence holds the key to endless new and exciting experiences we can develop for our ever-connected world. Soon, much of our world will be enhanced with AI. But I’m not going to bore you with all the gibberish of AI. Let’s get real. Just how on earth did Yaroslav Goncharov shoot his app to fame?<br></p>
<p>If there is anything you can take away from this recent craze, it’s that no matter how many apps are built, people will still download a good app even if it comes late in the game. There are billions of apps on the marketplaces today. But, it’s apps like FaceApp &#8211; those focused on users &#8211; that take the day. So start planning your app with your users in mind. That is a formula for success.<br></p>
